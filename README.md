<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;I am a full-stack software developer and Air Force veteran with more than 15 years of experience managing, architecting, implementing, and leading software and hardware solutions spanning across web, mobile, desktop, and site specific environments. My depth of knowledge and ability to gain understanding allow me to specialize in several areas spanning the industry, and my desire to learn and create is always driving me to become a more well-rounded and versatile asset to any team. I am continually learning new technologies and finding the best solution to any problem without compromising quality of end product or ethics of business relations. I am task-oriented and dedicated, with my communication skills and natural servant leadership style being indispensable attributes to my work and management methods. While I do enjoy 'reinventing the wheel' so to speak, my true passion comes out in my desire to create altogether better and more efficient  models, access, algorithms, and the ultimate end user experience through teamwork, gaining intimate knowledge of the code base, learning, testing, debugging, and collaborating.
